    1. Advanced knowledge in one or more technical domains as recognized by peers or management
	  Recognized as a domain expert in emerging technologies, evidenced by applied research in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for portfolio optimization (MSc 2021) and by founding the 'jAMS TechBytes' series, which educates an average of 20+ peers(across JPM LOBs) weekly on cutting-edge trends like AR/VR/XR, Agentic AI and Knowledge Graphs, fostering a culture of innovation beyond immediate responsibilities.
	
    2. Consistent high performance in relation to peers
	  Consistently operates at a level exceeding his grade, demonstrated by his pivotal role as one of only two architects on the high-impact AM RIO program. He regularly interfaces with and earns positive feedback from a wide range of senior stakeholders including engineers, workstream (operations) leads, product managers, and program leads across both AM and the CIB, effectively influencing direction and delivery beyond his immediate reporting lines.
	
    3. Makes continuous learning and skills building a priority
	  Champions continuous learning as a core professional discipline, consistently acquiring and disseminating advanced skills. He recently earned the demanding AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification (April 2025) to formally validate his expert-level cloud architecture capabilities. Simultaneously, he founded and leads the jAMS TechBytes series (from March 2025), a weekly forum to explore and share knowledge on frontier technologies with peers. This builds upon his proven ability to apply complex concepts, such as his prior hands-on work with reinforcement learning in the AWS Deep Racer program
	
    4. Passionate about technology, a curious mind
	  His innate passion for technology and curiosity is demonstrated by his voluntary pursuit of innovative projects beyond his core responsibilities. This was vividly illustrated by his 2024 Hackathon project, where he creatively used the classic game 'Space Invaders' to model and demonstrate Complex Event Processing (CEP) with Apache Flink, making a sophisticated technology accessible and engaging. He consistently channels this curiosity into sharing knowledge, delivering demos on AR/VR and presentations on Agentic AI through the jAMS TechBytes forum, inspiring others with his enthusiasm for the art of the possible.
	
    5. Open to receive and act on growth-oriented feedback
	  Exemplifies a growth mindset by actively seeking, internalizing, and acting on constructive feedback. For instance, based on input from stakeholders to increase his architectural influence, he now proactively champions the Architecture Catalog as the single source of truth, educating teams on its value to improve design consistency. He has also consciously elevated his voice in major program discussions, ensuring his strategic architectural perspective is clearly heard and recognized. These specific behavioral changes, noted and appreciated by his manager and stakeholders, demonstrate a tangible commitment to personal and professional development
	
    6. Demonstrate influence and impact
	  Demonstrates significant influence and impact at multiple levels: strategically, culturally, and externally. On the AM RIO program, his architectural designs are directly reducing technical debt and replacing manual processes with systematic solutions, leading to tangible gains in efficiency and risk reduction. His expertise is sought after, with team members like Sandesh proactively requesting his ongoing mentorship and supported Ritu during the initial phase of her external MSc program. Beyond his team, he shapes the firm's technical culture through the jAMS TechBytes series (84+ subscribers) and as the London Lead for the IGNITE Quantum community. His influence extends industry-wide, evidenced by his selection as a speaker at the global DEVUP conference (2024) and his upcoming return as a speaker in 2026, raising the firm's profile as a technology leader
	
    7. Clearly articulates strategic initiatives and  models open and transparent dialogue with stakeholders
	  He has institutionalized clear articulation and transparent dialogue through his disciplined stewardship of the AM RIO Architecture Catalog. This year, he has managed approximately 30 catalog items, ranging from essential system documentation to complex proposals involving strategic designs paired with interim tactical solutions. For each item, he facilitates rigorous discussions with stakeholders across Front to Back Office domains, incorporating lessons learned to ensure robust designs before seeking ratification at the IDA forum. This process consistently models a transparent and collaborative approach to governing strategic initiatives.
	  
    8. Evidence of contribution outside of immediate areas/ collaborations across teams and with stake holders
      Consistently contributes well beyond his immediate responsibilities, demonstrating a strong commitment to firm-wide collaboration. He actively builds bridges across lines of business through initiatives like the jAMS TechBytes series, which attracts subscribers from various teams, and his leadership in the global IGNITE Quantum community. His cross-functional engagement is further evidenced by his participation as a tech lead in Code for Good and by representing the firm as a speaker at the global DEVUP conference
	  
	9. Contributing to success of others 
	  Dedicated to elevating those around him through formal mentorship and creating platforms for collective growth. He provides ongoing mentorship to team members like Sandesh and supported Ritu during the initial phase of her external MSc program, demonstrating his commitment to colleagues' growth. Furthermore, by serving as a tech lead for Code for Good and founding the jAMS TechBytes series, he creates opportunities for peers to learn new skills. He is consistently sought out for advice by engineers and operations teams across the organization on diverse challenges, from AWS architecture and RDS optimization to CI/CD pipelines, enabling their success through practical, actionable guidance.
   
   10. is Expert engineer (E2) going to help the candidate
      Prasanth has already proven himself as an expert engineer; the E2 program is the crucial catalyst to forge him into a strategic technology leader for the entire firm. This investment will leverage his deep architectural skills and passion for mentoring to not only solve our most pressing challenges but also to elevate our entire technology practice, ensuring we retain top talent and drive measurable business transformation.
