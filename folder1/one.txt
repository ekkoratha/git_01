Summary of Current Testing Challenges in Middle Office Financial/Investment Operations
In our current Middle Office financial/investment operations, several domains and application areas are interconnected to support our processes. However, there are significant challenges related to our testing methodologies and environments that need to be addressed to ensure seamless and reliable end-to-end testing. Here are the primary issues identified:

1. Lack of Automated End-to-End Testing: Our current testing process relies heavily on manual efforts, with no system in place to automate end-to-end testing across the various domains and applications. This results in inefficiencies and increased chances of human error.
2. Absence of a Dedicated Testing Environment: We do not have a robust testing or production parallel environment that can validate the entire end-to-end flow of our systems. This limitation hinders our ability to conduct comprehensive testing before deploying changes to production.
3. Synchronization Issues Among Systems: Many of our systems depend on markers to signal the completion of tasks, triggering the next system in the flow. However, due to manual testing processes, achieving and maintaining this synchronization is challenging. Teams often resort to mocking these synchronization points to complete their tests, which compromises the integrity of end-to-end testing.

Key Points for Management:
* Manual Testing Reliance: The current dependence on manual testing results in inefficiencies and potential for errors, highlighting the need for automated testing solutions.
* Lack of Comprehensive Testing Environment: Without a dedicated testing or production parallel environment, we cannot fully validate end-to-end flows, increasing the risk of issues when deploying to production.
* Synchronization Challenges: The manual nature of our testing processes makes it difficult to achieve accurate synchronization between systems, often leading to incomplete or mocked tests.

Need for Automation and Robust Testing Framework: Implementing automated testing and a dedicated end-to-end testing environment will significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of our testing processes, ensuring better synchronization and comprehensive validation of all systems involved.
