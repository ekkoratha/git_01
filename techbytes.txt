Hello hello , 

As part of our mission to foster innovation and collaboration across AM services - affectionately known as jAMS - we launched Tech Bytes our weekly 30 mins session where team members(External speakers) share insights on the latest emerging technologies.

Think of it as a knowledge sharing hub to keep us aligned with industry standards while keeping our skills razor-sharp

okay - Just for fun lets assume its friday (not monday) and I have to confess In my mind my when I imagine fridays its something like this (here I start music and disco lights for around 5 seconds - Next show them the screen containing Matric style rain drop)

***** I am sharing my screen now and hopefully you can all see our confluence page
Please bear with me I will get to the Hall of FAME in a bit

Ever have that moment when you are zoning out at your desk , dreaming of weekend plans, when suddenly you realize - BHAM!! - its Tech Bytes time? This Tech Bytes isnt your average meeting. As the great Morpheus from the Matrix movie would say - "you take the blue pill - the meeting ends, you go back to your desk and believe what you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Tech Bytes and we will show you how deep the tech rabbit hole goes"

WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR
as you can see we have big list but here are some  
  * Agentic AI potential in Multi-Agents
  * Deep Dive into AWS servless tools
  * Gradio for Rapid ML prototyping
  * Explored the world of FinOps
  * Cursor AI, WindSurf , Devin
  * Immersive web tech using AR/VR 
  * Anthropic Model Context Protocol

WHY IT MATTERS
  
Tech Bytes isnt just about learning ; its about building a culture of curiosity and friendly competition. By sharing expertise we reduce silos and prove that â€˜alone we are smart, together we are genius.
If you are passionate about a topic - whether its Quantum Computing, Streaming data using Flink or anything else we would love to have you present or join the audience. Lets keep growing
 
We already have folks from other LOBs (CIB/CCB/Corporate sector/other AWM members, AI ignite community) join and show their interest. 
Well I have to warn you Enrique/akvile/deepshika if this popularity continues , we might end up hosting Tech Bytes conference soon similar to AWS re:Invent or devUP so please think about this in next year budget planning (this bit is for humour)

everyone is invited - join the fun by going to go/jams-techbytes  to subscribe to our newsletter one click go/jams-tb-subs 


coming back to the hall of fame .(show the brownie points page) jAMS also have a Brownie Points page where we award Virtual brownie points to team members who contribute by adding great articles or provide handy technical tips or host a tech bytes sessions. As you can see the competition is serious and we already have Q1 and Q2 winners on the board

Finally - remember - with great technology knowledge comes great responsibility. And great meme potential. See you friday, true believers (start music and disco lights)
